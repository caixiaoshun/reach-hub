    title: 'Knowledge Transfer and Domain Adaptation for Fine-Grained Remote Sensing Image Segmentation',
    authors: ["Shun Zhang", "Xuechao Zou", "Kai Li", "Congyan Lang", "Shiying Wang", "Pin Tao", "Tengfei Cao"],
    year: 'Dec, 2024',
    shortDescription: 'A novel end-to-end learning paradigm combining knowledge guidance with domain refinement for remote sensing image segmentation.',
    longDescription: `Fine-grained remote sensing image segmentation is essential for accurately identifying detailed objects in remote sensing images. Recently, vision transformer models (VTMs) pre-trained on large-scale datasets have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization. However, directly applying them to specific tasks may lead to domain shift. We introduce a novel end-to-end learning paradigm combining knowledge guidance with domain refinement to enhance performance. We present two key components: the Feature Alignment Module (FAM) and the Feature Modulation Module (FMM). FAM aligns features from a CNN-based backbone with those from the pretrained VTM's encoder using channel transformation and spatial interpolation, and transfers knowledge via KL divergence and L2 normalization constraint. FMM further adapts the knowledge to the specific domain to address domain shift. We also introduce a fine-grained grass segmentation dataset and demonstrate, through experiments on two datasets, that our method achieves a significant improvement of 2.57 mIoU on the grass dataset and 3.73 mIoU on the cloud dataset. The results highlight the potential of combining knowledge transfer and domain adaptation to overcome domain-related challenges and data limitations. `,

    title: 'Adapting Vision Foundation Models for Robust Cloud Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images',
    authors: ['Xuechao Zou', 'Shun Zhang', 'Kai Li', 'Shiying Wang', 'Junliang Xing', 'Lei Jin', 'Congyan Lang', 'Pin Tao'],
    year: 'Nov, 2024',
    shortDescription: 'Cloud-Adapter is a lightweight and efficient cloud segmentation method that enhances pre-trained vision models to achieve top performance across diverse satellite images and scenarios.',
    longDescription: `Cloud segmentation is a critical challenge in remote sensing image interpretation, as its accuracy directly impacts the effectiveness of subsequent data processing and analysis. Recently, vision foundation models (VFM) have demonstrated powerful generalization capabilities across various visual tasks. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient adaptive approach, termed Cloud-Adapter, designed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of cloud segmentation. Our method leverages a VFM pretrained on general domain data, which remains frozen, eliminating the need for additional training. Cloud-Adapter incorporates a lightweight spatial perception module that initially utilizes a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to extract dense spatial representations. These multi-scale features are then aggregated and serve as contextual inputs to an adapting module, which modulates the frozen transformer layers within the VFM. Experimental results demonstrate that the Cloud-Adapter approach, utilizing only 0.6% of the trainable parameters of the frozen backbone, achieves substantial performance gains. Cloud-Adapter consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various cloud segmentation datasets from multiple satellite sources, sensor series, data processing levels, land cover scenarios, and annotation granularities.`,
